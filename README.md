# Memory_Match
A simple memory match python game, written in pygame.
This program utilizes python 2.7 and package python-pygame (http://pygame.org/).
As such, both must be installed to run.
This game has only been tested on Ubuntu 14.04.

The images are not my original creation. They were taken from http://colome.org/
